## Schema

### Required

- `phone_numbers` (Attributes Set) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--phone_numbers))
- `primary_number` (String) If you have multiple direct phone numbers assigned to the shared line group, this is the primary number selected for desk phones.
The primary number shares the same line as the extension number. This means if a caller is routed to the shared line group through an auto receptionist, the line associated with the primary number will be used.
- `shared_line_group_id` (String) Unique identifier of the Call Queue.

<a id="nestedatt--phone_numbers"></a>
