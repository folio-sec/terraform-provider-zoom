## Example Usage

```terraform
# Define only one resource for each extension id.
resource "zoom_phone_call_handling_closed_hours" "example" {
  extension_id = "wGJDBcnJQC6tV86BbtlXXX"

  call_handling = {
    call_not_answer_action        = 1
    busy_on_another_call_action   = 21
    connect_to_operator           = false
    allow_callers_check_voicemail = false
    voicemail_greeting_id         = "" # default
    ring_mode                     = "simultaneous"
    max_wait_time                 = 30
  }

  # some extension can use call forwarding such as user
  call_forwarding = {
    require_press_1_before_connecting = true
    enable_zoom_mobile_apps           = true # Zoom Mobile Apps

  }

  # closed hours can handle after setting business_hours.custom_hours.type = 2
  depends_on = [
    zoom_phone_call_handling_business_hours.example
  ]
